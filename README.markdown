### Integrated Face Recognition System

Live Application:
https://iprashanthvanam.pythonanywhere.com/  



### Project Overview

The **Integrated Face Recognition System** is a complete web-based face recognition application built using **Flask** and the **face_recognition** library (powered by dlib).

It allows users to:
- Upload images and recognize known faces
- Perform real-time face recognition using webcam
- Add new people to the recognition database
- Delete existing people
- Instantly retrain face encodings without restarting the server

The project demonstrates a full end-to-end face recognition pipeline — from face detection and encoding, to persistent storage, real-time recognition, and a clean user interface.

- Add new persons with face images
- Delete persons from database
- Instant retraining of face encodings
- Face distance confidence score
- Responsive modern UI
- Persistent face encodings (pickle file)
- Support for multiple faces per image/frame
- Error handling & user feedback

### How to Use

Add Known Faces
- Go to **Manage Faces**
- Enter person's name
- Upload a clear face image (JPG/PNG)
- Click **Add & Retrain**

#### Recognize Faces
- **Upload Image**  
  → Go to **Upload & Recognize** → select image → see results

- **Live Webcam**  
  → Go to **Webcam** → allow camera access → real-time recognition starts

#### Delete a Person
- Go to **Manage Faces**
- Click **Delete** next to the person

#### Retrain Encodings
- After adding or deleting faces
- Click **Retrain Encodings** button
---

### Deployment Steps:
- Create account on https://www.pythonanywhere.com
- Upload files via Git or Files tab
- Create new Web App → Flask → Python version
- Set source code path:
```
cd /home/yourusername/face-recognition-system
```

#### WSGI Configuration:
```
import sys
path = '/home/yourusername/face-recognition-system'
if path not in sys.path:
  sys.path.append(path)
from app import app as application
```

#### Install dependencies:
```
pip install --user -r requirements.txt
```
